Student evaluations of instruction (SEIs/SAIs) are widely considered necessary by most universities, but the degree to which they are essential can vary depending on institutional goals and perspectives.​

Why SEIs/SAIs Are Seen as Necessary
Continuous Improvement: SEIs/SAIs provide actionable feedback, allowing instructors to adjust teaching methods, address student concerns, and continually improve course quality for future students.​

Accountability: They serve as one of the few formal means to hold faculty accountable for teaching effectiveness and student engagement, which is especially important for institutions valuing high-quality instruction.​

Personnel Decisions: SEI/SAI results are often integral to promotion, tenure, and contract renewal processes, helping ensure that teaching performance is fairly considered alongside research and service.​

Student Inclusion: These evaluations are one way to ensure student voices are heard in shaping their own educational experiences, fostering a sense of ownership and shared responsibility.​

Limitations and Debate
While necessary for the reasons above, SEIs/SAIs are not flawless. Research suggests potential issues with response biases, the impact of non-teaching factors (like course difficulty), and the risk of low participation rates limiting their representativeness. Many universities therefore use SEIs/SAIs in combination with peer review and other performance measures for faculty assessment.​

In conclusion, SEIs/SAIs are generally necessary to support instructional quality, ensure institutional accountability, and include students in the evaluation process, though they are most valuable when combined with other forms of teaching evaluation.
