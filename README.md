Common flaws with SEIs (Student Evaluations of Instruction) and SAIs (Student Assessment of Instruction) as practiced today include issues related to bias, validity, and representativeness, which can limit their effectiveness as measures of teaching quality.​

Key Flaws of SEIs/SAIs
Biases in Student Ratings: SEI/SAI responses can be influenced by factors unrelated to teaching effectiveness, such as instructor gender, ethnicity, course difficulty, or grade expectations, leading to potential unfair evaluations.​

Response Rate and Representativeness: Often, only a subset of students completes evaluations, which can skew results if the responders are not representative of the entire class.​

Focus on Popularity Over Learning: Evaluations may reflect student satisfaction or instructor likability more than actual learning or instructional quality, potentially rewarding less rigorous courses.​

Timing and Survey Fatigue: SEIs are typically conducted near course end when students are busy, leading to rushed or less thoughtful responses, and repeated surveys can cause fatigue and lower quality feedback.​

Institutional Responses
Many institutions supplement SEIs/SAIs with peer reviews, teaching portfolios, and other qualitative measures to get a fuller picture of teaching effectiveness.​

Efforts are ongoing to refine survey instruments to reduce bias and improve validity, and to increase student participation for more representative data.​

Overall, while SEIs/SAIs are useful tools, these flaws suggest caution in interpreting results and highlight the need for multiple metrics in assessing teaching quality.
