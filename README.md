Abstract Text:
Higher education requires that students invest significant time, money, and energy to earn degrees. Following each course, accredited universities and institutions solicit student feedback to evaluate faculty, course relevance, and the overall student experience through Student Evaluations of Instruction (SEIs). Despite the high investment and the opportunity for actionable feedback, SEIs face the same problems as other experience surveys. Students exhibit low engagement, reflected in low response rates and ‘flat’ answers that lack nuance and insight.

In this submission, we will discuss integrating LLMs within different elements of the survey. 
1. Raw Feedback - The first integration involves using traditional open-ended questions to engage students and clarify and expand upon brief, vague answers, thereby incentivizing students to provide detailed answers to their initial replies.
2. Peer Feedback - The second integration is through anonymized, rephrased feedback from peers about the course, allowing students to verify or reject claims based on their own experiences.
3. Analysis by Institution - The third integration is with the reporting side, enabling faculty to engage more deeply with the feedback.
